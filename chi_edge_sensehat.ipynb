    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook guide on using the [Waveshare Sense Hat (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Sense_HAT_(B)) within CHI@Edge, a sensor expansion board specially designed for Raspberry Pi that houses an onboard gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer, temperature and humidity sensor, etc.. This artifact will walk you through the steps to access and utilize the sense hat for your edge computing experiments.. \n",

    "- iot-rpi-cm4-02\n",

    "**Important Note:** There are only two devices with the peripheral attached at the moment. We currently are in the process of staffing several of our raspberrypi 4 devices with more of these peripherals; later, this month of June 2024, an official blogpost on peripherals will accompany this artifact presenting a hollistic approach for users to add peripherals to CHI@Edge. For now, please check out our extensive [documentation](https://chameleoncloud.gitbook.io/chi-edge/device-enrollment/peripherals-and-device-profiles) on how to add peripherals to CHI@Edge devices\n",
