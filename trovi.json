First, by showing how to lease a pre-configured sense hat-enabled device and then launch a fully featured container with the right device profiles and dependencies and several example scripts showcasing the use of the different sensors.\n\n   * Example Python scripts to read values from the various sensors.\n\n   * Readme with more in-depth information about how this device was set up behind the scenes to accommodate sense hat support. \n\nThis artifact is maintained on a best-effort basis by our support team, contributions to this peripheral support or any peripheral support on CHI@Edge are highly welcome. \n\nWe encourage our users to visit the newly updated official [documentation](https://chameleoncloud.gitbook.io/chi-edge/device-enrollment/peripherals-and-device-profiles) on how to enable peripherals on CHI@Edge devices.\n\nHappy sensing!",
